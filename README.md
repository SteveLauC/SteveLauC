#### About Me
 Steve is just a guy seeking happiness, value, and doing something good along 
 the way. 
 
#### Two quotes I really love
1. At one end you have people who are really mathematicians, but call what they're
   doing computer science so they can get DARPA grants. In the middle you have 
   people working on something like the natural history of computersâ€”studying 
   the behavior of algorithms for routing data through networks, for example. 
   And then at the other extreme you have the hackers, who are trying to write
   interesting software. - Hackers & Painters (Paul Graham)
2. What I cannot create, I do not understand. - Richard Feynman
